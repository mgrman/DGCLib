# DGCLib
*Demonstrative Geometrical Computer Library*

This library contains algorithms implemented during my studies at the University.
All implementations are made in a demonstrative manner and adhere to the original algorithm's definition. Therefore it may not be the most optimal implementation.

There are two main projects:
- *DGCLib_IK* which contains algorithms for solving Inversion Kinematics in 2D
- *DGCLib_Misc* which contains general geometrical algorithms

**Libraries are portable and can be used with any .Net project.**
